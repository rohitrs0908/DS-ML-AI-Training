Tokenizing your text by word allows you to identify words that come up particularly often. For example, if you were analyzing a group of job ads, then you might find that the word “Python” comes up often. That could suggest high demand for Python knowledge, but you’d need to look deeper to know more.\n",

    "Tokenizing by sentence: When you tokenize by sentence, you can analyze how those words relate to one another and see more context. Are there a lot of negative words around the word “Python” because the hiring manager doesn’t like Python?
